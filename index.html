                <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                <p>For this project, I was assigned the task of selecting a webpage to analyze based on usability and accessibility standards. Subsequently, I embarked on redesigning and constructing an improved version of the chosen webpage.                    .</p>

                <h2>II. Role</h2>
                <p>In the capacity of the UI/UX designer, I took the lead in crafting wireframes encompassing both low-fidelity and high-fidelity iterations. Subsequently, I translated these designs into a minimum viable product (MVP) coded website, seamlessly integrating all the recommended enhancements.                    .</p>

                <h2>IV. Problem/Context</h2>
                <p>Upon my arrival at Brown University, I sought out African cuisine to ease the transition of being away from home. However, I encountered challenges with the available websites, particularly in terms of clarity and detail. In particular, the website I chose for analysis suffers from subpar image quality and lacks clarity in conveying important information. Notably, the clash between the background and foreground elements detracts from the site's accessibility.</p>

                <h2>V. Wireframing</h2>
                <p> Following a comprehensive assessment of the website's usability and accessibility standards, I swiftly identified areas for improvement. Leveraging a structured approach, I dedicated nine minutes to produce nine wireframes, allocating one minute for each sketch. This rapid yet meticulous process ensured a focused exploration of solutions while maintaining efficiency.</p>
